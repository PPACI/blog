# About Pierre

I'm currently a Cloud Engineer specialized in **Azure** and **Kubernetes** working in Luxembourg ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º.
You can call also call me a SRE or a DevOps.
You won't be wrong since I always worked in startups and so had multiple hats...

Also I had a past life in **Deep Learning** where I took care of developping an automated tensorflow based learning platform.

You can check what I do on Github or Twitter. I'm always willing to discuss about tech, so feel free to contact!

Last but not least, you can consider me as a coffee nerd.
